This repository contains data and source code used for data naalysis and figure preparation for Yury Barbitoff's [PhD thesis](https://disser.spbu.ru/zashchita-uchenoj-stepeni-spbgu/815-barbitov-yurij-aleksandrovich.html)

*Note* The repository does not include code relevant for prion loss rate calculations.

Description of scripts and data files:
* `plot_luciferase.R` was used to plot luciferase refolding data.
* `Hsp40&Hsp70-titration.R` was used to analyze the binding of Hsp40 and Hsp70 to fibrils of Sup35NM and Rnq1 (Figures 10, 12, 15)
* `Sis1-NM-mutants.R` was used for analysis of interaction with Sup35NM mutant fibrils (Figure 14)
* `Ssa1-NM-validation.R` was used for analysis of Ssa1 binding to Sup35NM fibrils with 1:40 concentration ratio (Figure 16)
* `Hsp104-binding.R` was used to prepare Figure 17.
